# Incident Response Playbook

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a structured **Incident Response Playbook** designed to help security analysts detect, investigate, and respond to cybersecurity threats efficiently. It includes:

- **Step-by-step response guides** for phishing, malware, and unauthorized access incidents.
- **Automated Python scripts** to analyze security logs and detect threats.
- **Sample cases** to practice and improve incident response skills.

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kurotes95/incident-response-playbook.git
cd incident-response-playbook
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🛠️ Usage

### **1. Using the Playbooks**
- Open the relevant markdown file inside the `playbooks/` directory.
- Follow the step-by-step instructions for investigating and responding to incidents.

### **2. Running the Log Parser**
```bash
python scripts/log_parser.py samples/malware_log_sample.log
```
- This script scans system logs for suspicious activity, such as failed login attempts or malware execution.

### **3. Phishing Email Analysis**
```bash
python scripts/email_header_parser.py samples/phishing-email.eml
```
- Extracts important metadata from phishing emails to identify spoofed senders and malicious links.

## 🔥 Future Plans
- Add **more playbooks** for additional incident types (e.g., DDoS, insider threats, credential stuffing attacks).
- Enhance scripts with **real-time alerting** (e.g., integrate with SIEM tools like Splunk or ELK Stack).
- Include **interactive simulations** to test and refine response skills.
