# 🦠 Malware Incident Response Playbook

## 🔍 1. Identification
- Monitor alerts from antivirus, EDR, SIEM systems, or user reports.
- Analyze suspicious files/processes:
  - Unexpected file executions.
  - Unusual outbound network connections.
  - High CPU/memory usage from unknown processes.
- Check log files for indicators:
  ```bash
  python scripts/log_parser.py samples/malware_log_sample.log
  ```
- Isolate potentially infected systems from the network immediately.

## 🛑 2. Containment
- Disconnect affected machines physically or via network isolation.
- Disable infected user accounts temporarily.
- Block known malicious IPs, URLs, or file hashes across firewall and endpoint systems.
- Capture memory and disk images if needed for forensic analysis.

## 🧹 3. Eradication
- Remove malware files using trusted antivirus or manual deletion.
- Clear malicious registry entries or startup items.
- Patch exploited vulnerabilities (software, OS, plugins).
- Reimage systems if the infection is widespread or persistence is detected.

## 🔄 4. Recovery
- Restore affected systems from clean backups.
- Reset user credentials (mandatory if credential theft suspected).
- Reconnect systems to the network after confirming they're clean.
- Monitor systems closely post-recovery for unusual behavior.

## 📊 5. Lessons Learned
- Document:
  - Malware type and infection vector.
  - Impact assessment (data loss, downtime).
  - Timeline of detection, containment, and recovery.
- Update antivirus signatures and SIEM detection rules.
- Conduct user awareness training to prevent similar incidents.
- Review and improve patch management and network segmentation.
